My system architecture is the following: My macbook laptop, with multiple Virtual Machines running.
I am using Linux Ubuntu Server, with no UI installed.
My workstation will likely be my own base Laptop OS, with an SSH client, as I believe this is the most simple solution to work on the server.
I have run the following CLI commands (shown in my screenshots):
uname, free, dh-h, ip addr, and lsb_release
